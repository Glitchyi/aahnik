# Contributor Licence Agreement


If you are planning to contribute code to **any of my Open Source Projects**, you must abide by this agreement for your pull request to be merged.

The conditions are simple and easy to understand. These are the generally the standards in the open source word.

The contributor is required to make sure that:

- the contributor is the author of the contribution
- the contributor has the legal right to grant the copyright license
- the contributor does not have an employer that can claim rights in the copyright
- the contribution is an original work
- the contribution is not subject to third-party licenses, claims, suits, or actions

---

The contributor must
- publish the contribution under the same license as the project 
(prevents the author of a contribution to the open source project from later alleging patent infringement based on the contribution)

Note: A nonexclusive license is  granted back to the contributor, a “grant-back license,” which gives the original author permission to copy, modify, or distribute the contribution and its derivative works under the license of the project.
