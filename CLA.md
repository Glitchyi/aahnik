The conditions are simple and easy to understand. These are the generally the standards in the open source word.

The contributor is required to make sure that:

- the contributor is the author of the contribution
- the contributor has the legal right to grant the copyright license
- the contributor does not have an employer that can claim rights in the copyright
- the contribution is an original work
- the contribution is not subject to third-party licenses, claims, suits, or actions

The contributor must
- publish the contribution under the same license as the project 
(prevents the author of a contribution to the open source project from later alleging patent infringement based on the contribution)

Note: A nonexclusive license is  granted back to the contributor, a “grant-back license,” which gives the original author permission to copy, modify, or distribute the contribution and its derivative works under the license of the project.
