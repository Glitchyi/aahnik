# Contributor Licence Agreement

If you are planning to contribute code to **any of my Open Source Projects**, you must abide by this agreement for your pull request to be merged.

The conditions are simple and easy to understand. These are generally the standards in the open-source word.

The contributor is required to make sure that:

- the contributor is the author of the contribution
- the contributor has the legal right to grant the copyright license
- the contributor does not have an employer that can claim rights in the copyright
- the contribution is an original work
- the contribution is not subject to third-party licenses, claims, suits, or actions

---

The contributor must

- publish the contribution under the same license as the project 
    (prevents the author of a contribution to the open-source project from later alleging patent infringement based on the contribution)

Note: A nonexclusive license is  granted back to the contributor, a “grant-back license,” which gives the original author permission to copy, modify, or distribute the contribution and its derivative works under the license of the project.
